## Project Status

This project is currently archived, and active development has been paused indefinitely. No further work will be carried out unless a contributor is interested in improving the project or taking over its development.
The repository will remain available because the project has been useful to me, and I may revisit it in the future.


## 💎 The Sovereign Manifesto

In an era of surveillance capitalism, PennyPilot is a rejection of the baseline. We believe that managing your wealth shouldn't require surrendering your identity. 

**PennyPilot** is a local-first, privacy-engineered financial co-pilot. We have inverted the traditional AI model: instead of sending your sensitive data to the AI in the cloud, we bring the AI directly to your data, on your hardware.

## ⚡ Core Pillars

### 🧠 Forensic Intelligence
*   **On-Device OCR & LLM**: Utilizing **Google ML Kit** and **MediaPipe**, PennyPilot extracts dates, merchants, and itemized tables from receipts without an internet connection.
*   **Forensic Parsing**: A proprietary system prompt architecture converts messy OCR noise into structured JSON with 90%+ confidence.
*   **Subscription Detection Agent**: An ML-driven clustering engine that identifies "Zombie Subscriptions" and price hikes before they hit your balance.

### 🛡️ Hardened Privacy
*   **Zero-Knowledge Storage**: Data is persisted in an **Isar** NoSQL database with hardware-level encryption. 
*   **The Nuclear Option**: Instantly wipe all cryptographic keys and local databases via a dedicated security barrier.
*   **Biometric Sentinel**: Secured by industry-standard FaceID, TouchID, and Fingerprint sensors.

### 🔄 Local-First Sync
*   **CRDT-Based Engine**: Conflict-free Replicated Data Types ensure your data remains consistent across devices without an intermediary server.
*   **P2P WebRTC**: Cross-device synchronization happens directly over local networks—zero data ever touches a server.
