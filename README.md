## 🛡️ Our Ethos

In an era where personal data has become the currency of the internet, PennyPilot was born from a simple, non-negotiable principle: **Your financial life belongs to you, and you alone.**

We believe that managing your wealth shouldn't require surrendering your privacy. Traditional finance apps often trade convenience for surveillance, uploading your transaction history to third-party clouds for aggregation and analysis. PennyPilot rejects this trade-off.

We have engineered a system that brings state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence *to your data*, rather than sending your data to the AI. By leveraging powerful on-device processing units in modern smartphones, we deliver intelligent automation—receipt scanning, categorization, and predictive insights—completely offline.

**No tracking. No selling data. No cloud sync. Just you and your finances, flying safely.**

## ✨ Features

### � On-Device Intelligence
PennyPilot pushes the boundaries of what local-first apps can do. We utilize **Google's MediaPipe** and **ML Kit** to run Large Language Models (LLMs) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) directly on your device hardware.
*   **Smart Receipt Extraction:** Snap a photo of a receipt, and our local AI extracts the merchant, date, totals, and line items instantly.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Email Scanning:** Connect your email via direct IMAP. Our engine downloads emails to memory, scans them for transaction patterns locally, and discards the rest. Your credentials and emails never leave your device.

### 🔒 Sovereign Data Architecture
*   **Local-First Encryption:** All data is stored in a high-performance **Isar** database on your device's encrypted storage.
*   **Nuclear Option:** A dedicated "Danger Zone" allowing you to instantly wipe all cryptographic keys and data from the device, ensuring total data destruction if needed.
*   **Biometric Sentinel:** Optional biometric authentication (FaceID/Fingerprint) acts as a second layer of defense for app access.

### 🌍 Global Financial Fluency
*   **Real-Time Currency Normalization:** Spend in Yen, tracking in Dollars. PennyPilot fetches daily exchange rates to normalize your foreign spending into your primary currency automatically.
*   **"Safe to Spend" Analytics:** Our algorithms analyze your recurring fixed costs (subscriptions, rent, bills) against your income to calculate a daily "safe" spending limit, preventing lifestyle creep before it happens.

### 🎨 Human-Centric Design
*   **Dynamic UI:** We use deterministic color generation algorithms to create unique, recognizable pastel brands for every merchant you interact with.
*   **Subscription Intelligence:** The app identifies "Zombie Subscriptions"—services that have significantly hiked their prices or those you've stopped using but keep paying for.
