PennyPilot is a **100% Free and Open Source (FOSS)**, local-first, privacy-focused personal finance tracker built with Flutter. It automatically scans your emails (Gmail, etc.) for receipts and subscriptions, extracting financial data locally on your device without ever sending your sensitive email content to a cloud server.


## ✨ Features

- **Privacy First**: All email scanning and data extraction happen locally on your device.
- **Smart Scanning**: Automatically detects receipts and recurring subscriptions from your inbox.
- **Multi-Platform**: Supports Android and Desktop (Linux/macOS/Windows).
- **Material You**: Beautiful, adaptive UI using Material 3 and Dynamic Color.
- **Local Database**: High-performance local storage using Isar.
