**PennyPilot** is a sophisticated, privacy-first personal finance application that acts as your personal financial navigator. Unlike traditional apps that require you to manually input every coffee or upload your data to a black-box cloud, PennyPilot brings intelligence directly to your device. 

It automatically scans your inbox (Gmail) for receipts and subscriptions, extracting transaction details locally. **Your emails never leave your device.**

## � Privacy & Security

PennyPilot is built on the philosophy that **Financial Data is Private Data**.
1. **No External Servers**: We do not host any back-end servers that store your data.
2. **Local Scanning**: Email content is fetched via IMAP/APIs directly to your device and parsed in memory.
3. **Open Source**: The code is 100% open, allowing the community to audit our privacy claims.

## Roadmap

We are constantly evolving. Our current focus includes:
- [ ] **On-Device LLM**: Using Google's Gemini Nano for even smarter merchant extraction.
- [ ] **Biometric Lock**: Securing your data with Fingerprint/FaceID.
- [ ] **Expanded Detectors**: Supporting more languages and international merchants.
- [ ] **Data Portability**: Full JSON/CSV export for manual analysis.
