Resolving dependencies...
Because receipt_recognition 0.2.8 depends on google_mlkit_text_recognition ^0.15.0 and no versions of receipt_recognition match >0.2.8 <0.3.0, receipt_recognition ^0.2.8 requires google_mlkit_text_recognition ^0.15.0.
So, because pennypilot depends on both receipt_recognition ^0.2.8 and google_mlkit_text_recognition ^0.14.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on google_mlkit_text_recognition: flutter pub add google_mlkit_text_recognition:^0.15.0
